#Export pdf from SharePoint

You may find yourself in a situation when you want to visualize data from SharePoint lists in form of a pdf document. You can handle such a task using Excel pdf export but you will soon realize there are way too many limitations in this approach. Especially if you need to follow specific document layout or automate this task. Another SharePoint native approach is to use Sql Server Reporting Services (SSRS).
