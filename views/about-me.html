    My name is <strong>Jan Blaha</strong> and I am software engineer and senior software consultant. I come from Czech Republic where I am currently
    located in Prague.
</p>

<p>
    I have spent 8 years as a .NET developer helping big companies deploying enterprise systems, but my recent activities are focusing on open
    source and startup projects. You can read more about my current projects <a href="/current-projects">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My current passion is reporting platform <a href="http://jsreport.net">jsreport</a>. I am working on this project for almost two years and there is no doubt
    this is my master piece. If you are struggling with jsreport don't hesitate to reach me. I am also available to be hired if you are thinking about integrating jsreport into a bigger system.
